## Problem statement of our project :desktop_computer:
####
In the research paper, "A machine learning approach for future career planning", The user
had to give their current qualifications and the job they are aspiring. After assessing these
details, the machine learning model will provide a path which they need to follow, to reach
their job.
To make this decision easier and timesaving for the user, we can make certain additions like.
The current ranking of universities for a particular degree, the number of scholarships they
would provide, their admission deadlines and criteria. This would make the website a one
stop destination for someone who would want to pursue any career.
An improvisation to the current paper is that we can provide the user with a set of
alumni/employee email ids. This will not only help the user to connect with them but will
also be able to make a prudent decision as to select a particular course, job or even a career
field.

## Motivation:handshake:
####
The motivation for a research work titled "A machine learning-driven approach for comprehensive career path" could stem from several reasons. One possible reason is that individuals often struggle with finding the right career path and may not have access to personalized career advice. Traditional career guidance often involves self-assessment and advice from career counselors, but this process can be time-consuming and may not result in the best career fit.
Machine learning techniques have the potential to provide a more efficient and personalized approach to career guidance. By analyzing large amounts of data on job requirements, job satisfaction, and individual preferences, a machine learning-driven approach could identify potential career paths and make personalized recommendations to individuals.Furthermore, this research work could also help organizations in career development and succession planning for their employees. By using machine learning algorithms to analyze employee data, such as job performance, career interests, and skillsets, organizations could identify potential career paths and make recommendations for training and development opportunities to help employees reach their career goals within the organization.

Overall, a machine learning-driven approach for comprehensive career path has the potential to provide individuals and organizations with a more efficient and personalized approach to career development, making it a worthwhile area of research.

## Novel features are listed below:bulb:

- Ranking of universities provided in each career path.
- Scholarships provided by each of the universities.
- Admission deadlines of universities.
- Admission requirements for certain colleges.
- Suggestions from Alumni and current employees.

## Data collection: 

We aim to collect data from myriad sources like educational institutions, known universities, offices, workplaces, and startups. We do this by mailing people working or studying. We will also be contacting the institution or the HR department of a company. In addition to all these data, we will be taking the linkedIn dataset, which holds the entire details of people’s current job profile and their future goal.

### Dataset link of students and employees: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey
### Dataset link of Universities and colleges : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings

The data belongs to a kaggle survey, we slectedthis datset because of its varied number of columns, prefrences and easy work flow.

## Sorting of data:

The data that we aggregate from various resources needs to be sorted based on multiple factors, like the degree that needs to be completed before, or is a prerequisite for the other. Also the data of the universities also needs to be sorted, based on ranking, scholarships and other features. This sorting of data can be done by making use of various algorithms like quick sort or merge sort, depending on which one is more efficient and time saving on our data.

```
survey.groupby("Gender").size() 
survey[survey["Gender"].isin(["Male","Female"])].groupby("Gender").size() 
(survey[survey["Gender"].isin(["Male","Female"])].groupby("Gender").size()/len(survey[survey["Gender"].isin(["Male","Female"])].index))*100 
survey[survey["Gender"].isin(["Male","Female"])].groupby("Gender").size().transform(lambda x: (x/sum(x))*100)
survey["Gender"].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100 
survey["Gender"][survey["Gender"].isin(["Male","Female"])].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100 
survey["Age"][1:10]

```

## Data preprocessing:

The obtained data from the workplace may not be large enough to represent a big dataset. We need to oversample the data in order to avoid skewing of the result. We can make use of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), This is an algorithm used for oversampling imbalanced datasets. It is a type of data augmentation technique that generates synthetic samples of the minority class by interpolating between existing samples. The basic idea is to create synthetic samples by selecting a minority class sample and finding its k-nearest neighbors.
We try to achieve this by kMeans Smote and SVM Smote. KMeans-SMOTE is a variant of the SMOTE algorithm that combines the SMOTE oversampling method with the K-Means clustering algorithm, to create synthetic samples that are more representative of the minority class distribution. This can improve the performance of classifiers trained on imbalanced datasets, as it can help to address the class imbalance problem and prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class. We can also make use of SVM SMOTE, The basic idea behind SVM-SMOTE is to use the SVM classifier to identify the most difficult samples to classify in the minority class and then oversample these samples using SMOTE. This is done by first training an SVM classifier on the imbalanced dataset and identifying the support vectors, which are the samples closest to the decision boundary. These support vectors are then used to guide the SMOTE algorithm to generate synthetic samples that are more representative of the minority class distribution. 

### K-means Algorithm:

In the code we make use of Kmeans algorithm which is a popular clustering algorithm used in machine learning and data mining. It is used to partition a dataset into K clusters, where K is a predefined number of clusters. The algorithm assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center based on their distance from the center.
There are various reasons to use Kmeans. Out the various reasons, a few of them are:

- **Scalability**: *K-means is a scalable technique that can effectively handle huge datasets. The algorithm can process big datasets with hundreds or even millions of data points because its computational complexity is linear with the number of data points. Even if we change the dataset or add more data to it, our model will still be able to make very accurate predictions due to the use of Kmeans.*<br> 
- **Interpretable results**: *The K-means clusters can reveal information about the underlying structure of the data and are simple to interpret. Users can assess the algorithm's success by using the algorithm's quantitative assessment of the clustering's quality.*<br>  
- **Consistent results**: *K-means is a deterministic algorithm that produces consistent results every time it is run on the same dataset. This makes it easy to reproduce and validate results across different experiments and studies. This is a major reason to make use of Kmeans.*


## Categorization of Data:

The data that we acquire from the user and from the universities or offices, needs to be categorized, into different streams like Engineering, Medical and Commerce. We categorize the users’ needs and the external data to ensure accurate mapping. We make use of clustering algorithms, like KNN clustering or BIRCH clustering method to put similar attributes under one category

## Clustering of data:

After gathering a comprehensive dataset having many educational qualifications/degrees, job titles/job posts, we need to group them for better understanding. For example, software development engineer, software developer, programmer all can be grouped as "software engineer". We try accomplishing this by using the KNN algorithm.

## Chain creation:

after we have categorized our data, and mapped the users details with that of the universities or offices, next we need to form a chain, which will give a direct path. This path begins from your current position and searches in your category and gives you the path to reach your aspired job. We can make use of features like Markov chaining. This process will provide as many chains or paths as possible to reach your goal.

## Path prediction:

Markov chaining provides various chains that can be followed, out of all these provided chains, the chain which is most suitable and shortest is chosen and displayed to the user. The choosing of the shortest chain is done with the help of bellman Ford algorithm, this algorithm will help us in finding the shortest path among the many paths which we get as output from the chaining process.

## Displaying output:

Finally, after the optimal and shortest path is chosen, this path along with the relevant details needs to be displayed in an engaging way to the user, we can display this output in a website which can be integrated with the machine learning and dataset. We can integrate python code with website using flask, and the database can be integrated by making use of mongoDB and NodeJS. The front end of the website can be prepared with the help of ReactJS.

## Evaluation Metrics:fountain_pen:
In the research paper "A machine learning approach for future planning", an algorithm is devised which gives the most optimal chain to choose the correct career path based on the current qualifications and aspiring job, but this paper does not provide guidance on how each of these steps are to be followed, the user of the algorithm will have to collect information from different websites to clear their doubts.
The algorithm devised in this study gives the users a one stop destination, after which the users will not have to search for further information about degree requirements, college rankings, scholarships, and fees.
This will ease the process of future planning and will create a proper guide for the users. 


## Challenges faced:thinking:

####
####
Challenges faced for our project model is procuring and sorting of the erratic data generated by universities and companies. The ever-changing details of each university should be kept abreast. The elicitation of student or employee email ids from the respective sources like institutions, workplaces, and universities can be a conundrum. It would require making a good connection 
with sources.
